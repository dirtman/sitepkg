## go-sitepkg - framework for basic sys-admin utility commands

go-sitepkg implements the common functionality of the primarily perl-based
"SitePkg" utilities developed over the last few decades by the Rice Middleware
group to manage a wide range of our critical campus services.
The sole purpose of go-sitepkg is to ease our transition toward developing Go-based
utilities with the same look and feel of our existing utilities.

**go-sitepkg is not intended for modern projects** - much more appropriate and
complete frameworks (Cobra/Viper, Kong, etc. etc.) are available and should be
pursued.
